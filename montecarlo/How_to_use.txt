How to read: every function here starts with a `>` before its name

===============================================================================================================================

DataSimulator
    >simulate_one(PDF* p): returns a single value out of a PDF with the statistical properties of that PDF
    >simulate_sample(vector<PDF*>* vp): returns a vector of values as above


ErrorPropagator
    abstract class for propagating errors: derivate classes must reimplement function `f`

    constructor: ErrorPropagator(v): `v` is a vector<PDF*>*
    >f(): it is the function of the variables whose PDFs are in the vector passed to the constructor
    >propagation(n,seed,min,max,steps,name): builds a PDF by `n` iterations between `min` and `max` with `steps` steps and name `name`


LinearFit
    this object can both work with internal or external vectors. To work with internal vector just omitt the data vectors in every function.
    To fill the internal vectors you can use both the `>add` function or `>set_data`

    >fit(file_name,start_line,end_line): builds the PDFs of the parameters of the line y = a + b*x interpolating data in `filename`
					 in lines [`start_line` : `end_line`]. To obtain those PDFs use functions `getA()` and `getB()`
    >fit(xV,yVP): `xV` is a vector<double>* and `yVP` is a vector<PDF*>*
					it does the same thing of the previous, but picking up data from the vectors

    >intersec(file_name1,file_name2): returns a PDF** containing the PDFs (`ix` and `iy`) of the x and y coordinates of the intersection between the interpolating lines of `file_name1` and `file_name2`
    >intersec(file_name,a,b): returns a PDF** containing the PDFs of the x and y coordinates of the intersection between the interpolating line of `file_name` and 
			      y = a + b*x

    >add(input,xV,yVP): this is a VERY USEFUL routine of the LinearFit object: `input` is an ifstream*, `xV` is a vector<double>*
			and `yVP` is a vector<PDF*>*. This functions adds data `xV` `yVP` reading from a file that has to be in the following
			file format.
			To use this function you will only need to setPrecision, so you can use it also for initializing data in a ParametricFit

   >chi2(xV,yVP): returns the chi square
   >rho(xV,yVP): returns Bravais-Pearson correlation coefficient
   >T_N(): returns the value for the T_student associated with rho
    
    File format:
	x_value		yPDF_type	yPDF_a		yPDF_b
	
	    yPDF_type =
		      "Uniform"	 		-> yPDF_a = min,	yPDF_b = max
		      "Triangular"		-> yPDF_a = center,	yPDF_b = full width
		      "Gauss"			-> yPDF_a = mean,	yPDF_b = sigma
		      "Digital"			-> yPDF_a = value	yPDF_b = digit		yPDF_c = gain
		      "Oscilloscope"		-> yPDF_a = V,		yPDF_b = Vdiv                 it considers a contribute of 3% gain + 0.05*Vdiv of digits
 		      
    Settings:
	>setAB_steps(n)	-> set the number of steps of the `a`,`b`,`ix`,`iy` PDFs
	>setPrecision(n)	-> set the number of steps of the PDFs of the simulated sample
	>setN(n)		-> set the number of iterations
	
    Further settings:
	to use the function `fit`:
	    >setA_range(m,M)	-> set min and max value for the `a` PDF
	    >setB_range(m,M)	-> set min and max value for the `b` PDF
	    
	to use the function `intersec`:
	    >setIX_range(m,M)	-> set min and max value for the `ix` PDF
	    >setIY_range(m,M)	-> set min and max value for the `iy` PDF


ParametricFit
    this object provides three ways of performing a parametric fit with a function depending both on fixed parameters (known PDFs) and unknown parameters in order to find
    to find the unknown parameters PDFs. As always data need to be in the format explained above.
    To get the unknown PDF use >get_unknown_PDF(name)
    In order to define the fitting function you need to define a class inheriting from ParametricFit::Func; for example the linear function should be defined as
		
		class linFunc: public ParametricFit::Func {
 			   public:
				linFunc():
			  	Func("linFunc"){}
				~linFunc(){}
	
				virtual unsigned int n_fix(){return 0;}
				virtual unsigned int n_unk(){return 2;}
				virtual double f(double x, vector<double>* v_fix, vector<double>* v_unk){
	  				return v_unk->at(0) + x * v_unk->at(1);
				}
		};
   
   There are functions to set and add fixed or unknown parameters: see ParametricFit.h
   The three modes are:
	- ParametricFit::value
		the probability of a particular tuple of unkown parameters is proportional to the average value intersected from the function on the dataset
	- ParametricFit::p_value
		same but with p-values instead of values
       If there are no fixed parameters doesn't matter: so use 1!
       If the function does not intersect one of the data the probability for that particular tuple of unknown parameters will be 0. In order to change this behaviour set `min_value` 
       to a small positive number. Be careful because the larger `min_value` is the wider the unknown PDFs will be.

	- ParametricFit::brute_force
		this method is pretty unefficient as it scans all the possible tuples in order to find the best with the minimum square method. In order to obtain a significant result many
		repetitions: and it will take a LOT of time


PDFFactory
    abstract class for building PDFs

    >create(min,max,steps,name): creates a PDF between `min` and `max` with `steps` steps and name `name` using a generic function `f` that is reimplemented in derived classes
    >create_default(steps): create a PDF with `steps` steps, this function is reimplemented in every derived class
    
    derived classes
	GaussFactory(mean,sigma): builds gaussians
		default gaussian are created in [mean - 5*sigma : mean + 5*sigma]
	UniformFactory(a,b): builds a uniform distribution between `a` and `b`
		default uniforms are created in [a,b]
	TriangularFactory(center,fullwidth): builds triangular distributions
		default triangulars are created in [`center` - `fullwidth`/2 : center + `fullwidth`/2]
	DigitalFactory(center,digit,gain): builds a PDF resulting from a measurement with a digital instrument
		with errors due to `digit` and `gain` (this one is a percentage, e.g.: 0.03)
		default digitals are created where they are non 0
		This PDFs are created via a propagation of two uniform distributions
		

PDFFactoryManager
    >create(PDF_type,PDFa,PDFb): creates a PDFFactory with type `PDF_type` and parameters `PDF_a` and `PDF_b`
				
				see LinearFit -> File Format -> yPDF_type

STANDARD  WAY OF BUILDING PDFs via a PDFFactory

PDFFactory* F = PDFFactoryManager::create(PDF_type,PDFa,PDFb);
PDF* pdf = F->create(min,max,steps,name);
delete F;
