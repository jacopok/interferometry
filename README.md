Code and resources for the Galileian Interferometer for the Measurement of Light Index (GIMLI),
a project for the measurement of the index of refraction of a liquid
with interferometric techniques.

A summary of the results and methods can be found in the [poster](https://github.com/jacopok/interferometry/blob/master/poster_GIMLI.pdf),
while a more detailed explanation of the experimental process is given in the [handbook](https://github.com/jacopok/interferometry/blob/master/Handbook/handbook.pdf).

The project was performed in spring 2019 by Alberto Facheris, Francesco Gentile, [Alessandro Lovo](https://github.com/AlessandroLovo), [Giorgio Mentasti](https://github.com/Mentasti24), [Jacopo Tissino](https://github.com/jacopok), [Leonardo Zampieri](https://github.com/lzampieri); and supervised by [Marco Zanetti](https://github.com/mzanetti79).
